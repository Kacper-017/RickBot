# RickBot
This discord chatbot impersonates Rick from Rick&Morty

Well it turns out Rick&Morty dataset only has about 1800 rows with only 20% of them being Rick so I opted to use The Office dataset instead. 

Well it turns out using a lot of data comes with running out of memory on google colab. Decided to change model from medium to small and changed the character from Jim to Kevin. The training worked although the bot wasn't very smart. Issues with deploying the model on hugging face caused me to pause the development.
